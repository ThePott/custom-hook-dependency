# ❓ Custom Hooks Are Just Extended Component Code!
**Why you need to think of custom hooks as part of your component**

## 📖 Introduction
**Custom hooks are NOT separate entities** - they're just refactored component code!
When you use a custom hook, imagine copy-pasting all its code directly into your component. That's exactly how React treats it.

This app demonstrates why understanding this concept is crucial for dependency arrays in custom hooks.

## ✨ Main Feature
1. **Custom hooks = Component extension**: See how custom hook code behaves exactly like component code
2. **Dependency array implications**: When you understand custom hooks as extended component code, dependency array rules become obvious
3. **Side-by-side comparison**: Compare what happens with and without proper dependencies

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This app demonstrates:
1. React custom hooks
2. React useEffect hook
